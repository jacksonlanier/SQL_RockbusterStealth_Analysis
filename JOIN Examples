  c.name AS film_category,
  SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM film AS f
  JOIN inventory AS i
  ON f.film_id = i.film_id
  JOIN rental AS r

  JOIN payment AS p
  ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id
  JOIN film_category AS fc
  ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
  JOIN category AS c
  ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY f.title, film_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;

  ON cu.address_id = a.address_id
  INNER JOIN city AS c
